Real-world examples for medical diagnosis: In the case of rare diseases, the joint use of facial recognition software and machine learning helps scan patient photos and identify phenotypes that correlate with rare genetic diseases. Real-world examples of statistical arbitrage: Machine learning optimises the arbitrage strategy to enhance results. Machine learning can classify available data into groups, which are then defined by rules set by analysts. Machine learning can extract structured information from unstructured data.
